# CodeIgniter 3 View Layout

CodeIgniter view layout system that makes it simple to use one or more base page layouts across your application. Layouts support sections of content that can be inserted from any view being rendered. You could create different layouts to support one-column, two-column, blog archive pages, and more. Layouts are never directly rendered. Instead, you render a view, which specifies the layout that it wants to extend.
